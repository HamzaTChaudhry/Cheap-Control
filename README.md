# Embodied-Cognition

This project is aimed at simulating the natural behavior of a model organism in neuroscientific research, Caenorhabditis elegans. It is special in being the only animal to have its connectome (i.e. every neuron and synapse) completed mapped. We are reproducing its behavior using artificial neural networks in order to study the contribution of body-environment interactions in behavioral control. Nematodes have two behavioral modes, swimming and crawling, which are usually posited as having separate neural activation patterns until recent experiments in whole-brain imaging in freely moving worms have shown evidence to the contrary. We'd like to prove that this can be explained by understanding synergistic contributions of the worm's anatomy and surrounding fluid dynamics in simplifying cognition.
